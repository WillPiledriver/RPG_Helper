## Formatting for dice roller:
{_Number of dice_}__d__{_Number of sides_}__+__{_Additional modifier_}__*__{_Number of times to roll_}

You can have multiple different rolls in a set by using a semicolon "__;__" as a delimiter.

Example:
**"1d6;2d10+5;5d100+25*3"** will roll one d6, two d10s + 5, and five d100s +25 three times

Input "__q__" to exit loops
