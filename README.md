## Formatting for dice roller:
{Number of dice}d{Number of sides}+{Additional modifier}*{Number of times to roll}

You can have multiple different rolls in a set by using a semicolon ";" as a delimeter.

Example:
"1d6;2d10+5;5d100+25*3" will roll one d6, two d10s + 5, and five d100s +25 three times

Input "q" to exit loops
